# Natural-Language-Prediction
### We are predicting whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. If so, predict a 1. If not, predict a 0

## Columns
**id - a unique identifier for each tweet**

**text - the text of the tweet** 

**location - the location the tweet was sent from (may be blank)**

**keyword - a particular keyword from the tweet (may be blank)**

**target - in train.csv only, this denotes whether a tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0)**

## This is a Kaggle Competition 
### Description
### Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
### The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).
### But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster. Take this example:
### The author explicitly uses the word “ABLAZE” but means it metaphorically. This is clear to a human right away, especially with the visual aid. But it’s less clear to a machine.

### In this competition, We are challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.
